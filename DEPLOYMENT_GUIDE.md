5. **What-If Simulation** ✅ - Test changes before implementation
6. **Real-Time Analytics** ✅ - Live dashboard with AI-powered insights
7. **Decision Support** ✅ - Intelligent recommendations and predictions

## 🎨 **Technical Highlights**

### **Backend Architecture**
- **Flask Framework** - Lightweight Python web application
- **SocketIO** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **RDFLib** - Semantic web library for ontology processing
- **Jinja2 Templates** - Dynamic HTML generation

### **Frontend Features**
- **D3.js Network Graphs** - Interactive relationship visualization
- **ECharts Analytics** - Professional data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS** - Modern, responsive styling
- **Anime.js Animations** - Smooth micro-interactions

### **Data & Reasoning**
- **OWL/RDF Ontology** - Complete semantic model
- **SWRL Rules** - Custom reasoning logic
- **Real-time Processing** - Live data updates every 10 seconds
- **Predictive Analytics** - Forward-looking insights

## 📊 **Sample Data Overview**

### **Emergency Department KPIs:**
- **Average Wait Time**: 42 min (Warning - 40% above target)
- **Patient Satisfaction**: 87.3% (Excellent - exceeding target)  
- **Bed Occupancy Rate**: 78% (Good - optimal range)
- **Triage Accuracy**: 92% (Excellent - high precision)

### **Cross-Departmental Relationships:**
- **Wait Time → Patient Satisfaction** (80% negative impact)
- **Medication Errors → Length of Stay** (60% extension)
- **Report Turnaround → Treatment Speed** (70% acceleration)

### **AI-Generated Insights:**
- **🚨 Critical**: Medication error spike detected
- **⚠️ Warning**: ED wait times above target during peak hours
- **💡 Opportunity**: Radiology capacity available during off-peak
